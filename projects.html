        <h2>The things I am proud of</h2>
        <h4>Do you enjoy training as having fun?</h4>
        <p>
          There is a lot of people who think that sport is a hard work. And
          staying fit is exhausting. But I totally disagree with this statement.
          I strongly believe that everyone can enjoy the process of training as
          we can enjoy eating icecream or watching movies. I teach boxing. And I
          show people the different side of this severe kind of sports. There is
          some place for jokes, fun and intelectious work. And I do enjoy
          showing this implicit part of boxing to others.<br />
          There are some photos I would like to share
        </p>

        <section class="textonpicture">
          <p class="blackbox">
            There is Mr. Anderson on the first photo. He is like Neo from
            Matrix. He always fights. And his enemies are his own weekness, lack
            of knowledge and laziness. He was shy at the very beginning of our
            training. But after a while he considered boxing as a sort of
            meditations. And I was surprised by his tricks he was making with a
            great sense of humour during the sparrings. It is not that hard to
            get hits to your body if you laugh after all
          </p>

        <section class="textonpicture">
          <p class="blackbox-mirror">
            There is Mr. Alex Shift on the second photo. After few days of
            training his punches became really tough. I think he has got an
            "killer instinct". He was chasing his opponent all the time. A good
            habbit not only in boxing. Alex shew good progress. But beyond
            boxing the training was his way to stress of and communicate to
            others.
